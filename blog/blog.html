                                What are we doing? That seems a simple question, one that wouldn’t sweep you away with the dark reminder that very little that we do actually matters. I don’t bring this up as some grand revelation or a juvenile attempt to sound philosophical or self important, the reality as we all know is this; our hours of labor are oftentimes for naught, the only difference is today, it doesn’t matter to us or those we hold dear</p>

                                I had this thought when reviewing some code a few days ago, anyone familiar with the subject matter most likely knows that oftentimes the safest and ‘cleanest’ solution is provided in its most simple form. Instead this code compacted what could have easily been 10-15 lines into 4, as a result it was near impossible to read. The reader may be asking, why would someone do this? The answer is not for the sake of optimization or any sense of structural integrity but that of ego. This concept can transfer to many other fields. I believe many don’t do out of a desire to be, they do out of a desire to be seen and recognized. In this instance the original author wanted to be recognized for their depth of understanding, their intelligence, their cunning, but instead it leaves people like me confused, and alienated as a result.

                                ‘Everyone wants to be an artist but no one wants to do art’. I can’t remember where I read this quote but it really struck me and I feel it’s particularly poignant to the subject at hand. Ego inflation has swept over every waking thought of the American mind, it is fed to us through our media and how we interact with each other. Too many people have an image of themselves entirely incongruent with who they actually are. In an era of ‘locking in’ I often wonder if anyone actually means what they say and if they actually want to do what they do. What matters most to the modern American is not how you are but how you are perceived. You see it all the time in academia, everyone wants to be smart, no one wants to be ignorant, and as a result no growth is achieved. The same could be said for the arts, when fear of failure overtakes the necessity to be human you cannot be fulfilled.

                                This issue has flooded computer science departments with uninspired and unmotivated students that seem to have convinced themselves that this career path is ‘easy’ and a surefire way to obtain a six figure salary right out of college. This issue is doubly worse due in part to rising education costs, with your financial future at stake. Why pursue something you’re only 50% sure about? I implore the reader to follow their heart, and if you don’t know what you like, through trial and error I am certain you can figure out what you hate.
